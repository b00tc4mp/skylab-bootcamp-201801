# oneDayTrip
car pooling app oriented at one day trips for tourism

# Brief
This app works as blabla car but with an orientation to one day trips for tourism : 

All trips have a return in the same day, and the user can see all the trips available from a choosen point, and between 2 dates

By default the app shows all the available trips in the next 7 days by geolocating the user

Users can publish trips or search and book trips, after a confirmation process which is explained in the mockup
This app allow people who go on holidays somewhere to discover new places around, and to add an inexpensive and friendly transport mode as the same time.

as well to allow other users to share their car when they go on a trip

This is a starting point, as i will continue developing features on this app as a playground for learning and experimenting new things
