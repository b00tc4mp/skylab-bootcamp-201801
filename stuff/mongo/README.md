# Mongo with Brew

==> Pouring mongodb-3.6.3.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
To have launchd start mongodb now and restart at login:
  brew services start mongodb
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.6.3: 19 files, 297.6MB
